# Emma plays a mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds
# Some clouds are TH some are C
# Each cloud has a number
# She can jump on any C cloud with a number equal to current cloud or + 1 or 2
# She cannot jump on the TH clouds
# Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take Emma to jump from her start
#   to the last cloud. Assume it is always possible to win the game
# Emma will get an array of clouds numbered 0 if safe, 1 if not: c = [0,1,0,0,1,1,0]
# The number on each cloud is its own index in the array c


# Your function should return the minumum number of jumps it takes to win the game
# The first and last clouds are always safe to jump on

# Sample input:
#   7
#   [0 0 1 0 0 1 0]


c = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
print c

print c
